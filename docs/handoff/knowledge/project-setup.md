# Project setup — what the app is, where things live, how to run and verify

> **Provenance.** This began as one of Jason Diaz's local Claude Code memory files

DocRefine Pro is a local document-processing desktop app (Python + PySide6/Qt): dedup, PDF flatten/OCR, Office sanitize, export. Engine in `docrefine/` (worker/processing/reporting/config + gui/). Version tracked in `docrefine/config.py` (`CURRENT_VERSION`) and `CHANGELOG.md`.

- GitHub repo: **https://github.com/weblife-task-agency/DocRefinePro** (`main`). Transferred from the
  author's personal account `jasonweblifestores` on 2026-09-30; GitHub redirects the old URL, so older
  clones and links still resolve. History was committed with the local git identity
  Jason Diaz <jason@weblifestores.com> — set your own before you commit.
- The clone was restored after a local data loss on 2026-07-09 to `C:\Users\WORK\Documents\WebLife Labs\PROJECTS\DocRefine Pro\DocRefinePro` (shallow, `--depth 1`, no full history/tags).
- No system Python originally. Installed Python 3.10.11 via winget to `C:\Users\WORK\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe` (the `python`/`py` commands on PATH are Microsoft Store stubs — do not use them).
- Verification venv at `<project>\.venv` (git-ignored) with `requirements.txt` installed. Headless GUI smoke test: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py --dry-run` with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.
- Builds run in GitHub Actions on `v*` tag push (Win + Mac); Mac job also runs the `--dry-run` smoke test. See [known issues](known-issues.md).
