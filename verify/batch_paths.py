"""Which batch the per-batch helpers act on — one place instead of six copies.

Every helper used to carry its own `SRC = .../Batch 4/...` triple, so a new
batch meant hunting the same three literals through seven files, and the Batch 4
kit going missing from disk broke all of them at once. Select a batch with the
DRP_BATCH environment variable:

    set DRP_BATCH=batch4     (or mbw, the default)

Wording (tagline/disclaimer) is read from the KIT, never hard-coded, because a
literal from one brand silently passes on another: `all("" in b)` is True for
every page, so a blanked tagline check verifies nothing while looking green.
Use `TAGLINE_EXPECTED` to branch — it says whether this kit stamps one at all.
